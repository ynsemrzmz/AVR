# AVR
 All the applications in this repository have worked with Atmega328p.You can check Atmega328p-Datasheet for detailed informations like register descriptions etc.I have focused to learn 
 fundamentals of important microcontroller programming concepts like  digital input-output , adc,timers,interrupts,uart,spi,i2c etc.So this repository'S applications are not much complicated.I will use 
 this applications to develop bigger projects with Avr microcontrollers.
